# Lockbyte

Lockbyte is a stylish, GUI-based Caesar Cipher tool built with Python's `tkinter` and `Pillow`.  
It’s a **fake encryption/decryption demo**—great for presentations or educational use—but it **does not perform real cryptographic operations**.

- Real-time UX enhancements: pulses, sparkles, and fade-in effects
